This is an often observed but little analyzed activity; it makes an important contribution to family nutrition and sometines income, but has been neglected in studies of urban informal activities, food supplies to urban areas, household labor, and development. This paper investigates the past and present agricultural work done by urban women in Mozambique, and shows that the inclusion of this area of female endeavor improves our understanding of the process of urbanization. This paper documents the history of womens urban agricultural work during the solonial era, findings that alter ideas that his work is only related to preiods of economic crisis. Another intriguing aspect was the discovery that the majority of women who worked full time in the garment or cashew factories also invested time and energy in urban family agriculture. This work was not only the province of women who were etherwise unemployed and had the time to devote to growing food for their families. The adaptation of womens rural labor to the urban setting, even for women with full-time waged jobs, speaks eloquently of the rural impact on African city life.

It shows that early Kurdish nationalist politics was highly factionalized, \u0026 analyzes how Kurdish nationalist leaders responded to the collapsing Ottoman state \u0026 the emerging Kemalist regime. Kurdish nationalism is the result of the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire during \u0026 after WWI. A brief examination of Hourani's paradigm is provided to help understand the function of Kurdish notables in the Middle Eastern context. The author chose the Kurdistan Tealy Cemiyeti (Society for the Advancement of Kurdistan (SAK)) to illustrate Kurdish nationalist leadership. Exploring the social \u0026 familial background of two important Kurdish families, the author determined that Kurdish notables were the catalyst for social \u0026 political change among the Kurds \u0026 played a major role in the development of Kurdish nationalism. Kurdish nationalist leaders maintained different views of the political future of Kurdistan, but were united in their hostility toward the Turkish state. A better understanding of the Kurdish nationalism can be achieved when its relationship with the Ottoman Empire is taken into consideration. 3 Figures.

It is motivated by villagers\\' comments--\"no somos iguales\"--about economic inequality within the community and explores the nutritional consequences of this disparity. Analyses of energy intake, measured seasonally by the food-weighing technique, show that women in poorer households experience energy deprivation during the pre-harvest season but better-off women do not. During the rest of the year, women in both economic groups have statistically similar intakes of energy. Energy deprivation among poorer women is associated with a lack of money to purchase adequate amounts of commercial foods when the supply of local foods dwindles. The analyses indicate that in this agricultural community, being \"cash poor\" is a more sensitive predictor of nutritional risk among women than are landholdings. Despite the veneer of widespread poverty, this study supports villager views that households are not equal and contributes to our understanding of differences among rural Andean women.

Although the three countries share the values of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, having ratified it, their laws and practices with regard to the child\\'s identity rights have little in common. Explaining the different approaches to abandonment, the article argues that these are justified by stories about the birth giver as the \"real\" mother, stories that vary according to place and culture. This leads to different conceptions of the child\\'s identity and of motherhood, to exclusions and stigma. Focusing on the justifications offered in each country for its laws and practices, the article analyzes discourses of nature (England), juridical constructs (France), and pragmatic concerns for the child\\'s life (Germany). The article concludes that, given the myriad of family forms and of life experiences, it is not surprising to find that countries governed by a shared international convention give very different accounts of the meanings of identity and motherhood.

THIS IS AN OFTEN OBSERVED BUT LITTLE ANALYZED ACTIVITY; IT MAKES AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO FAMILY NUTRITION AND SOMETINES INCOME, BUT HAS BEEN NEGLECTED IN STUDIES OF URBAN INFORMAL ACTIVITIES, FOOD SUPPLIES TO URBAN AREAS, HOUSEHOLD LABOR, AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE PAST AND PRESENT AGRICULTURAL WORK DONE BY URBAN WOMEN IN MOZAMBIQUE, AND SHOWS THAT THE INCLUSION OF THIS AREA OF FEMALE ENDEAVOR IMPROVES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESS OF URBANIZATION. THIS PAPER DOCUMENTS THE HISTORY OF WOMENS URBAN AGRICULTURAL WORK DURING THE SOLONIAL ERA, FINDINGS THAT ALTER IDEAS THAT HIS WORK IS ONLY RELATED TO PREIODS OF ECONOMIC CRISIS. ANOTHER INTRIGUING ASPECT WAS THE DISCOVERY THAT THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WHO WORKED FULL TIME IN THE GARMENT OR CASHEW FACTORIES ALSO INVESTED TIME AND ENERGY IN URBAN FAMILY AGRICULTURE. THIS WORK WAS NOT ONLY THE PROVINCE OF WOMEN WHO WERE ETHERWISE UNEMPLOYED AND HAD THE TIME TO DEVOTE TO GROWING FOOD FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THE ADAPTATION OF WOMENS RURAL LABOR TO THE URBAN SETTING, EVEN FOR WOMEN WITH FULL-TIME WAGED JOBS, SPEAKS ELOQUENTLY OF THE RURAL IMPACT ON AFRICAN CITY LIFE.

ANALYSES OF ENERGY INTAKE, MEASURED SEASONALLY BY THE FOOD-WEIGHING TECHNIQUE, SHOW THAT WOMEN IN POORER HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCE ENERGY DEPRIVATION DURING THE PRE-HARVEST SEASON BUT BETTER-OFF WOMEN DO NOT. DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR, WOMEN IN BOTH ECONOMIC GROUPS HAVE STATISTICALLY SIMILAR INTAKES OF ENERGY. ENERGY DEPRIVATION AMONG POORER WOMEN IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LACK OF MONEY TO PURCHASE ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF COMMERCIAL FOODS WHEN THE SUPPLY OF LOCAL FOODS DWINDLES. THE ANALYSES INDICATE THAT IN THIS AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY, BEING \"CASH POOR\" IS A MORE SENSITIVE PREDICTOR OF NUTRITIONAL RISK AMONG WOMEN THAN ARE LANDHOLDINGS. DESPITE THE VENEER OF WIDESPREAD POVERTY, THIS STUDY SUPPORTS VILLAGER VIEWS THAT HOUSEHOLDS ARE NOT EQUAL AND CONTRIBUTES TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENCES AMONG RURAL ANDEAN WOMEN.
